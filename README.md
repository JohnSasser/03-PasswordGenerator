# 03-PasswordGenerator

This is a password generator powered with html, css and javascript

# 03-Homework / .js built Password Generator

DISCLAIMER: "Math.random() does not provide cryptographically secure random numbers. Do not use them for anything related to security. Use the Web Crypto API instead, and more precisely the window.crypto.getRandomValues() method." (MDN Web Docs)

This javascript powered Password Generator will create a randomized password between 8 & 128 characters. As stated above, do not use this current version for any personal security purposes. I will be updating the password generator in the future to include a true, Crypto API secure random, generating method.
